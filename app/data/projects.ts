    blurb: "An advanced computational platform that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to revolutionize the analysis of genetic and genomic data, making complex bioinformatics workflows accessible to researchers without extensive programming expertise. This cutting-edge project addresses the critical challenge in modern biological research where the exponential growth of genetic sequencing data has outpaced traditional analysis methods, creating a bottleneck that slows down breakthrough discoveries in medicine, agriculture, and evolutionary biology. The platform integrates state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition in DNA sequences, automated variant calling and annotation, predictive modeling for protein structure and function, and intelligent data preprocessing pipelines that handle raw sequencing data from various sources. Built with Python and leveraging powerful libraries like TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and BioPython, the system provides an intuitive web interface where researchers can upload genetic data, select analysis workflows, and receive comprehensive results with visualizations and statistical insights. The platform implements parallel processing for handling large-scale genomic datasets, incorporates pre-trained models for common bioinformatics tasks, and offers customizable pipelines for specialized research needs. This project represents the convergence of computer science and life sciences, demonstrating how AI can accelerate scientific discovery by automating complex analyses that would traditionally require weeks of manual work, while maintaining the accuracy and reproducibility essential for scientific research.",

    title: "BengkelAI — Smart Motorcycle Workshop Ecosystem",
    blurb: "A revolutionary AI-powered platform that transforms the motorcycle service industry by creating an intelligent ecosystem connecting riders, mechanics, and workshops through advanced technology. BengkelAI addresses critical pain points in the traditional workshop experience including lack of transparency in pricing and service quality, difficulty finding trustworthy mechanics, inefficient diagnostic processes that rely solely on mechanic expertise, and absence of maintenance history tracking. The platform leverages cutting-edge artificial intelligence and IoT integration to provide intelligent motorcycle diagnostics using machine learning models trained on thousands of common motorcycle issues, enabling riders to get preliminary diagnoses by describing symptoms or uploading photos/videos of problems. The system features a comprehensive digital trust badge system where mechanics earn verified credentials based on completed services, customer ratings, and skill assessments, helping riders make informed decisions when choosing service providers. BengkelAI implements subscription-based preventive maintenance programs with automated reminders based on mileage and time intervals, complete service history tracking across multiple workshops, and transparent pricing with detailed breakdowns before service begins. Built with a modern tech stack including Remix.js for a blazing-fast frontend experience, Firebase for real-time data synchronization and authentication, Flask as the Python backend for AI model serving, and advanced ML frameworks including Llama for natural language processing of user queries, scikit-learn for predictive maintenance algorithms, and TensorFlow for image-based diagnostic models. The platform also integrates IoT capabilities for workshops to connect diagnostic tools directly to the system, enabling real-time data collection and more accurate AI predictions. This comprehensive solution not only improves the rider experience through transparency and convenience but also empowers mechanics with digital tools to grow their business, manage appointments efficiently, and build their professional reputation in the digital age.",
